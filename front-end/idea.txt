### Frontend (Next.js):

1. **UI Design and Layout:**
   - Design a responsive and user-friendly interface for the typing race game using Next.js components and CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Material UI.
   - Implement pages for the game lobby, race room, leaderboard, user profile, etc.

2. **Real-Time Communication:**
   - Utilize WebSocket technology (e.g., using Socket.IO) to enable real-time communication between players during the typing race.
   - Implement features like live updates of race progress, chat between players, and notifications.

3. **Typing Race Gameplay:**
   - Develop the core functionality of the typing race game, including starting a race, displaying text to type, measuring typing speed, and finishing the race.
   - Implement validation for correct typing and calculate typing speed and accuracy.

4. **Multi-Language Support:**
   - Integrate libraries or APIs for handling multilingual support, such as i18next, to support both Amharic and English languages.
   - Allow users to switch between languages seamlessly.

5. **Leaderboard:**
   - Display the leaderboard showing the fastest typists based on region (country or city).
   - Implement filters to display leaderboards for different regions.
   - Update leaderboard in real-time as new race results come in.

### Backend (Django):

1. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system or third-party libraries like Django Rest Framework JWT.
   - Manage user profiles and preferences.

2. **Database Management:**
   - Design the database schema to store user data, race results, leaderboard statistics, and other relevant information.
   - Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for efficient data storage.

3. **WebSocket Integration:**
   - Set up WebSocket connections using Django Channels to handle real-time communication between players.
   - Implement WebSocket consumers to manage race rooms, handle chat messages, and update race progress.

4. **Localization and Internationalization:**
   - Enable support for multiple languages in Django using built-in features or third-party libraries like Django Translation.
   - Store translated strings for Amharic and English languages.

5. **Leaderboard Management:**
   - Implement logic to calculate and update leaderboard statistics based on race results.
   - Store and retrieve leaderboard data efficiently for displaying on the frontend.

6. **API Endpoints:**
   - Develop RESTful API endpoints for frontend interactions, such as fetching race data, submitting race results, and retrieving leaderboard information.

### Deployment:

- Deploy the frontend and backend components separately using platforms like Vercel (for Next.js) and Heroku (for Django).
- Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the deployment process.

### Additional Features:

- Implement social features like friend invitations, multiplayer challenges, and social sharing.
- Add customization options for race settings, such as text difficulty and race duration.
- Integrate analytics tools to track user engagement and performance metrics.
